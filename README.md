# RedditBot
Created a simple Reddit bot that will search a specific subreddit and leave a comment after matching a certain word or phase.

The certain phase that this bot currently is looking for is "Chuck Norris". 
After finding a comment which mentions Chuck Norris, the bot then replies with a fun fact about him!

Such as
>"The original title for Alien vs. Predator was Alien and Predator vs Chuck Norris. The film was cancelled shortly after going into preproduction. No one would pay nine dollars to see a movie fourteen seconds long."
